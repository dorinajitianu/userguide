    <p>The <b>Oxygen</b> team is dedicated to developing software products that are usable for
      everyone, including those with physical challenges and disabilities. <ph keyref="product"/>
      was designed to adhere to the U.S. Government Section 508 accessibility standards: <xref

      <title>Adjusting Fonts and Colors</title>
      <p>If you have low vision, go to <menucascade>
          <uicontrol>Options</uicontrol>
          <uicontrol>Preferences</uicontrol>
          <uicontrol>Appearance</uicontrol>
          <uicontrol>Fonts</uicontrol>
        </menucascade> where you can adjust the font styles and sizes used in the entire
        application, both for the editing areas and UI labels. If you have color blindness, you can
        also adjust most of the colors used in <ph keyref="product"/> by going to <menucascade>
          <uicontrol>Options</uicontrol>
          <uicontrol>Preferences</uicontrol>
          <uicontrol>Appearance</uicontrol>
        </menucascade> and changing the current color theme. You can also search for other
        color-related setting in the <b>Preferences</b> dialog box.</p>

      <title>Text to Speech Narrators (JAWS)</title>
      <p>If you are using a text to speech narrator, <ph keyref="product"/> support this since it is
        a Java application and it is periodically tested on Windows using the JAWS screen reader:
          <xref href="http://www.freedomscientific.com/Products/Blindness/JAWS" format="html"
          scope="external"/>.</p>
      <p>For JAWS to work, you need to enable the Java access bridge in <ph keyref="product"/>:
          <xref
          href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/access/enable_and_test.html"
          format="html" scope="external"/></p>
      <p>Since <ph keyref="product"/> comes bundled with its own Java VM, you need to open a console
        in the <filepath>jre</filepath> folder bundled with <ph keyref="product"/> and run the
        following command:</p>
      <codeblock outputclass="language-ini">D:\PATH\TO\OXYGEN_INSTALLATION_FOLDER\jre>bin\jabswitch -enable</codeblock>
      <p>You will receive a notification in the console that the access bridge has been enabled.</p>
      <p>Once the Java access bridge is enabled and if the JAWS narrator is active, when <ph
          keyref="product"/> starts, the narrator will start reading content from <ph
          keyref="product"/> and you can interact with the application, read menus, content from
        opened XML documents, and UI components from dialog boxes and side views.</p>

      <title>Hints for the Visually Impaired</title>
      <p>Here are a few hints for using <ph keyref="product"/> if you are visually impaired:<ul
          id="ul_owd_cv5_xcb">
          <li>The top main menu should contain most of the actions that you need to open, save, and
            close documents, switch between opened documents, or switch between the various editing
            modes for XML documents that are already opened.<ul id="ul_hyq_hv5_xcb">
              <li>The <uicontrol>File</uicontrol> menu contains actions to open, save, or close the
                currently edited XML document.</li>
              <li>The <uicontrol>Edit</uicontrol> menu contains actions to undo/redo or
                cut/copy/paste content. They also have the usual shortcuts that can be used instead
                of directly invoking the actions from the menu.</li>
              <li>The <uicontrol>Find</uicontrol> menu contains an action to show the
                  <uicontrol>Find/Replace</uicontrol> dialog box. Sometimes the <b>JAWS</b> narrator
                overloads the <b>CTRL-F</b> shortcut and presents its own find/replace window but
                the <ph keyref="product"/>
                <uicontrol>Find/Replace</uicontrol> dialog box provides the ability to perform
                complex find/replace operations in the opened file.</li>
              <li>In the <b>Options</b> menu, you have access to the <b>Preferences</b> dialog box
                that contains global application settings and access to the <b>Menu Shortcut
                  Keys</b> table where you can configure shortcuts for the most commonly used
                actions.</li>
              <li>The <b>Window</b> menu includes actions to switch between opened XML documents.
                Also, you can use the <b>Show view</b> submenu open a particular side view and move
                the focus to that view.</li>
            </ul></li>
          <li>An opened XML document can be edited with accessibility support either in the
              <b>Text</b> editing mode (where the XML tags are accessible in the edited content) or
            in the visual <b>Author</b> editing mode (where the XML tags are hidden and only the
            text content is shown). You can switch between these editing modes by using the <menucascade>
              <uicontrol>Document</uicontrol>
              <uicontrol>Edit Mode</uicontrol>
            </menucascade> menu.<ul id="ul_jgk_nk1_ycb">
              <li><b>Text</b> mode provides access to the entire source document with all of its
                  <b>XML</b> content, just like you have in any text editing application. In
                addition, using the <menucascade>
                  <uicontrol>Window</uicontrol>
                  <uicontrol>Show view</uicontrol>
                </menucascade> submenu, you can change focus to the <b>Attributes</b>,
                  <b>Elements</b>, or <b>Outline</b> view. The <b>Attributes</b> view presents the
                existing and possible attributes that can be inserted in an XML tag. The
                  <b>Elements</b> view shows you the list of XML elements that can be inserted at
                cursor position (also, pressing F2 on a selected element presents its annotation).
                The <b>Outline</b> view shows the current path in the XML structure.</li>
              <li><b>Author</b> mode is useful for reviewing written XML content because it has
                support for change tracking and for adding comments. Editing in the <b>Author</b>
                visual editing mode, you have access only to the text content in the XML document.
                Pressing <b>Shift-F2</b> will read to you the location in the XML structure. Again,
                you can also use the <b>Outline</b> view for this. In the <b>Author</b> editing
                mode, you can also use the <b>Attributes</b> and <b>Elements</b> views similar to
                using them in the <b>Text</b> editing mode. Pressing <b>ENTER</b> in the
                  <b>Author</b> visual editing mode can also be used to present a list of allowed
                elements at the current position.</li>
            </ul></li>
        </ul></p>
